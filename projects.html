            <h3>Productivity Tracking Mobile App</h3>
            <p class="tech-stack">Stack: Flutter, Firebase, Google Gemini API</p>
            <p>
                A cross-platform productivity application built with Flutter and Firebase. 
                It helps users enhance focus, track distractions, and monitor moods using 
                <strong>Smart Task Tracking</strong> and <strong>AI Assistance 🤖</strong>. 
                While the system features three distinct roles (User, Coach, Admin), 
                I specialized in the <strong>Coach Role</strong>, engineering the dashboard for mentors 
                to manage client relationships, view <strong>AI-driven Risk Diagnostics</strong>, 
                and drive engagement through a custom <strong>Gamification System 🏆</strong>.

            <h3>Eat For Tomorrow: The Food Choices Journey 🍎</h3>
            <p class="tech-stack">Stack: HTML, CSS, Vanilla JavaScript</p>
            <p>
                A story-based browser game developed for a Hackathon by Team Keluar. 
                Players navigate a 14-day journey making daily food choices that affect 
                <strong>Health ❤️, Wallet 💰, and Environment 🌳</strong> stats. 
                Features include interactive mini-games (like Memory Game & Supermarket Dash) 
                and multiple endings based on user decisions.

            <h3>Hospital Patient Care Management System 🏥</h3>
            <p class="tech-stack">Stack: C++, Data Structures, File I/O</p>
            <p>
                A console-based simulation designed to optimize hospital resource management during peak operations. 
                I developed the <strong>Emergency Department Module</strong>, implementing a custom 
                <strong>Priority Queue</strong> using linked lists to automatically triage critical patients 
                based on severity. To meet strict performance constraints, I utilized 
                <strong>Manual Memory Management</strong> (avoiding STL libraries) and built the integration logic 
                to coordinate real-time ambulance dispatch and medical supply logging.
